# topoCLIM
Methods to downscale climate timeseries from CORDEX RCM data.

This scheme specifically addresses the need for hillslope scale atmospheric forcing timeseries for modeling the local impact of regional climate change projections on the land surface in complex terrain. The method has a global scope and is able to generate the full suite of model forcing variables required for hydrological and land surface modeling at hourly timesteps. 

It achieves this by utilising the previously published TopoSCALE scheme \citep{Fiddes2014-wt} to generate a synthetic observation of current climate at hillslope scale, while accounting for a broad range of surface-atmosphere interactions. These synthetic observations are then used to debias (downscale) CORDEX climate variables using the quantile mapping method. A further temporal disaggregation step produces sub-daily fields. This approach has the advantages of other empirical-statistical methods, namely speed of use, while avoiding the need for ground data, which is often limited. It is therefore a suitable method for a wide range of remote regions where ground data is absent, incomplete, or not of sufficient length. The approach is evaluated using a network of high elevation stations across the Swiss Alps and a test application of modelling climate change impacts on Alpine snow cover is given.
